# League Wins Pool

## Getting Started

    cd src/client
    npm install
    bower install
    gem install compass
    
    cd ../server
    npm install

In the client folder command line tab do a `$ grunt serve` and let the thing fire up on `localhost:9000` in your web browser. Close that web browser tab, you don't need it.

In the server folder command line tab do a `$ npm test` and your express server will begin running on `localhost:3000`.
